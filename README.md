# Youtube-Most Subscribed Channel Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing data from the most subscribed YouTube channels. The aim was to explore patterns in subscriber counts, video views, and content categories while also comparing trends across different YouTube eras. The analysis was done using SQL (Snowflake) for data queries and Excel for creating visualizations.

Objectives of the project included:

- Understanding general statistics of YouTube channels.

- Exploring subscriber growth across different eras.

- Identifying categories that dominate in subscribers and video views.

- Highlighting the top 5 and top 10 channels by influence.

Methodology:
The dataset included details such as channel names, subscribers, video views, categories, and the year each channel started. Queries were written in SQL to clean and summarize the data (e.g., checking nulls, duplicates, averages, and totals). Channels were grouped into eras such as Pre-YouTube (<2005), Early Era (2005–2009), Growth (2010–2014), Mainstream (2015–2019), and Modern (2020+).

Excel was used to visualize results in different forms such as bar charts, pie charts, and column charts.

Key Results:

- Subscriber growth was much higher in the Growth and Modern eras compared to earlier years.

- Entertainment and Music are the dominant categories by both subscribers and views.

- A few channels, such as T-Series (29%) and YouTube Movies (20%), account for a large share of total subscribers.

Visuals produced include:

- Average subscribers by era.

- Top 5 channels by subscribers.

- Views per content category.

- Average subscribers per category.

Tools Used:

-Miro for planning.

- SQL (Snowflake) for querying.

- Excel for visualizations.
